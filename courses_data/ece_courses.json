The ICCAP model optimization is highly challenging, requiring iterative, non-linear fitting to find the global optimum parameters that simultaneously satisfy complex I-V and C-V curves. Furthermore, conceptually linking physical fabrication parameters in TCAD to the resulting analytical compact model parameters for predictive modeling remains a significant hurdle.",

This is a physics-based approach where you define fabrication parameters (like doping profiles and device structure) and simulate the resulting electrical characteristics, such as Current-Voltage (I–V) curves. This step provides the synthetic data that links fabrication to electrical performance.ICCAP (Integrated Circuit Characterization and Analysis Program) Phase: This phase uses Keysight ICCAP to perform the core modeling work. You take the I–V data (either simulated from TCAD or experimental) and use it to execute parameter extraction. This means finding the optimal values for the variables in an analytical model (like BSIM or a power device-specific model) so that the model's output curve perfectly fits the measured or simulated data.
